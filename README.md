Transporte-itla-final

Application that improves the ITLA ticketing platform. It consists of two parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is made with react and the backend with C#.

It was my final project at ITLA. At that time I didn't mastered so much the backend, but the frontend is ok.

Some of the features it improves from the original platform are:

A map that allows you to see where the stops are.
A tutorial on how to use it
Frequently asked questions
The ability to use the user balance to pay for the ticket.
Allows administrators to validate the ticket with a qr-code.
